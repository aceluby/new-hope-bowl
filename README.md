# NewHopeBowl

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
This will also start up the NodeJS server, with proxy config enabled.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
*Note: This produces a prod build*. You must access the site at port 4300 rather than 4200 when not in dev.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Tips
Sometimes when running the app, you may get an error message like the following
`Node Sass could not find a binding for your current environment: OS X 64-bit with Node.js x.x
`
First, verify you are using the correct node version `node -v` then `nvm use 6.9.1`<br>
If the app still fails to start, run `npm rebuild node-sass` and that should fix it.
